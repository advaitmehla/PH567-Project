All the code used for the report is included in the Jupyter notebook. The images included can explain what the code is doing pretty well. After the initial function declarations, the two cells are used for generating x-y phase plane diagrams with various other conditions that can be imposed. The last cell can create x-t diagrams that can show impulse trains for the right values of z.
