# PH567-Project

All the code used for the report is included in the Jupyter notebook. The images included can explain what the code is doing pretty well. After the initial function declarations, the two cells are used for generating x-y phase plane diagrams with various other conditions that can be imposed. The commented lines can be uncommented to enable things like iterating in negative time and adding arrows to show flow directions.

The last cell can create x-t diagrams for various values of z, and can demonstrate impulse trains for large negative values.
